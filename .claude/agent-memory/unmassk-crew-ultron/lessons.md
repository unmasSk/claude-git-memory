## H-2 symlink fix order matters

When fixing the hardcoded `test_role` symlink in validate_role.sh, `ROLE_NAME` must be computed **before** the heredoc that references it (not after). The original code computed ROLE_NAME after the heredoc. When moving ROLE_NAME earlier, the heredoc can use `${ROLE_NAME}` correctly.

## FAILED=0 initialization

validate_playbook_security.sh and validate_role_security.sh reference `$FAILED` in the final summary (`$FAILED security issue(s)`) but never initialize it. This causes an unbound variable error under `set -u`. Add `FAILED=0` next to `ERRORS=0` and `WARNINGS=0`.

## Python path validation hooks: fail-closed patterns

When writing a Python PreToolUse hook that validates file paths:
- Normalize with `os.path.normpath()` BEFORE any trigger substring check — double-slashes and `..` segments bypass literal checks.
- Use `os.path.realpath()` (not `os.path.abspath()`) on BOTH the target path and git root — realpath resolves symlinks; abspath does not.
- For not-yet-created files, resolve the parent with realpath and append the filename.
- Fail CLOSED when git root is unavailable — return `{"decision": "block"}`, never `{"decision": "approve"}`.
- Wrap the entire `main()` in `try/except` — any unhandled error must also return `{"decision": "block"}`.
- On Windows NTFS, use `os.path.normcase()` on both sides of `startswith` to neutralize drive-letter case mismatches and case-insensitive filesystem bypass.
- Build the valid prefix with `os.path.join(...) + os.sep` (not string concatenation with `/`) so the boundary check is exact.
- Emit `sys.stdout.flush()` after every `json.dump` call.

## set -euo pipefail vs set -e

Bare `set -e` doesn't catch unset variable references (`-u`) or pipeline failures (`-o pipefail`). Always use `set -euo pipefail` in new and existing scripts.
